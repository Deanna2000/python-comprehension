## Instructions

1. Define a dictionary that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.
    ```
    my_family = {
        'sister': {
            'name': 'Krista',
            'age': 42
        },
        'mother': {
            'name': 'Cathie',
            'age': 70
        }
    }
    ```
2. Using a dictionary comprehension, produce output that looks like the following example.
    ```
    Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
    ```

    > **Helpful hint:** To convert an integer into a string in Python, it's `str(integer_value)`


## Output looks like this:

```
family_dictionary git:(master) python family_dict.py
My family! {'Michael is my brother4 and is 55 years old', 'Betty is my mother and is 87 years old', 'Patrick is my brother3 and is 58 years old', 'Callen is my brother1 and is 62 years old', 'Tim is my brother2 and is 61 years old'}
